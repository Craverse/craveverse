# Unified Workflow Strategy Plan

1. Gather Inputs – Review existing docs (`PLAYBOOK.md`, `COMPREHENSIVE_TESTING_STRATEGY.md`, `ITERATIVE_TESTING_STRATEGY.md`, `SMOKE_TESTS.md`, `TEST_PLAN.md`, `TEST_RESULTS.md`) and relevant API routes to capture current workflows, templates, and testing coverage.
2. Define User-Centric Workflow – Map the end-to-end user journey (landing → onboarding → dashboard → missions → rewards/battles → referrals) and specify required API touchpoints with request/response templates and success metrics.
3. Refine QA Strategy – Merge existing testing practices into a single cohesive methodology covering automated API tests, integration flows, manual smoke passes, and monitoring checkpoints.
4. Produce Unified Guide – Draft a new `.md` (e.g., `WORKFLOW_QA_PLAYBOOK.md`) with sections for user workflow, API templates, testing matrix, monitoring/alerting, and update cadence.
5. Review & Polish – Cross-check coverage against original docs, ensure terminology alignment, and add actionable next steps for teams.
